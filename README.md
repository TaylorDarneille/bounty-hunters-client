# SEIR 713 Intergalactic Bounty Hunters React Client

---

### API

This client has been modified for use with [this API](https://github.com/TaylorDarneille/bounty-server-v1) assuming it is running locally on `port 8000`. Alternatively, you can replace the urls in the `fetch` calls with `'https://bounty-time.herokuapp.com/v1/bounties'`, a deployed version of the API.
